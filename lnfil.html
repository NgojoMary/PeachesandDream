				Let's not fall in love,
				<br>We still haven't seen the real us
				<br>We still are fragile and far from being tough
				<br>Don't look at me
				<br>Cause your eyes are black holes
				<br>Sucking me up in a world that is you
				<br>Don't smile at me
				<br>I'll get attached to you
				<br>and miss you and call you every time
				<br>I don't want to be annoying
				<br>So don't try to find me
				<br>When I stay away
				<br>You're making this more painful,
				<br>making me more sinful
				<br>Don't hold my hand
				<br>Like we are entwined knots
				<br>We'll end up bruising each other hearts
				<br>Don't call me sweet names
				<br>as we kiss under the rain
				<br>We'll end up being dead to each other
				<br>No eulogies said to each other
				<br>Let's not fall in love
				<br>with so much vulnerable hearts
				<br>We don't want another restart	
				<br>where tears and scars are already carved
				<br>Don't ask me anything
				<br>I still can't give you an answer
				<br>"I love you" is still something I try to ponder
				<br>Don't expect too much from me
				<br>Our innocence is too much pressure on me
				<br>I get nervous day by day
				<br>But all I can do for now is stay
				<br>Don't trust me
				<br>because I hide so much from you
				<br>My mysteries will just turn into our miseries
				<br>My depressions of losing you are building up inside
				<br>I keep failing trying to tell you
				<br>Don't be too kind to me
				<br>I'll grow fond of you
				<br>My heart would race faster than it already did
				<br>You'll become my drug issue
				<br>Let's not fall in love
				<br>because I'm a little scared
				<br>I'm sorry I'm a coward
				<br>Don't try to trap us
				<br>with fairytale fantasies
				<br>all of those are just fallacies
				<br>Don't try to have me
				<br>Let's stay as we are now
				<br>Don't dry my tears
				<br>Even when you don't know the reason you wipe them away
				<br>it's like a criminal solving his victim's case
				<br>Don't protect me from anything
				<br>Maybe we're bound to hurt each other in the end
				<br>Maybe one will let go
				<br>the other one will hold on
				<br>Let's not fall in love
				<br>Our smiles will turn into tears
				<br>Frequent meet-ups will turn into break-ups
				<br>Our praises will turn into fights
				<br>It's been always like that
				<br>Always the same as hellos and his
				<br>That will end up with goodbyes
				<br>So don't stop me from stopping this
				<br>Let's not fall in love
				<br>because love is a greed that can't be filled
				<br>I don't want to lose you
				<br>So before things get too deep, before we get hurt
				<br>Let's not fall in love
				<br>or make promises
				<br>I just want us to stay like this
				<br>Let's not fall in love
				<br>Let's not fall apart
